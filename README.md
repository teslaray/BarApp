# BarApp
This should be the code for my android Bar app

The Idea is this. In the App i should have 3 main categories. 

1. Drinks
2. Drinklist
3. Locations

The (1) Drink section is where i have my Database of all the Drinks I want to be able to mix
The (2) Drinklist option is there to create a list of your personal preferences, and has some predefined Lists from the best Bars in Zürich
The (3) Option should simply show the locations of the most liked bars in zürich (Well i dont have any real statistic for this so I should say, that those are my personal most liked bars)

If you live in Zürich and have some Ideas for me what could be added or how i should make my code better, feel free to add whatever you want. I'm an complete programming noob, so the code is for sure not the best.

Have fun checking out my repository.


Cheers Chris
